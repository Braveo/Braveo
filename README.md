### Doesn't matter what time of day it is. It is always a good morning for you. 👋

I'm Bravo, studying for Computer Science at Fresno State! Class of 2025. Aside from Computer Science, I'm a jack of all trades hobbyist artist, meaning I do 3D art, 2D art, animation, music, and storytelling. This all culminates into hobbyist game development.

Here's a little bit about me:
- I started making Minecraft animations at age 11. Worked for various Youtubers.
- Properly started learning how to code at age 12. Started in Python, HTML/CSS/JS at age 12, C# at age 13, C++ at age 17. Currently learning Rust.
- Started learning how to use Unity at age 13. Made a couple of small games on [Itch](https://braveo.itch.io/). 
- Released my first major game in 2021, titled RAYBOUND. It is free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1626370/Raybound/). 
- Currently working on an unnamed sequel during my free time as I keep studying.
