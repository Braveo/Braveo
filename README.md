## Good morning. üëã

I'm Bravo, studying for Computer Science at Fresno State! Class of 2025. Aside from Computer Science, I'm a jack of all trades hobbyist artist, meaning I do 3D art, 2D art, animation, music, and storytelling. This all culminates into hobbyist game development.

Here's a little bit about me:
- ‚õèÔ∏è I started making Minecraft animations at age 11, for fun. Worked for various Youtubers. Uploaded on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGy1MGq1qcujetf7GqPCITQ).
- ‚å®Ô∏è Properly started learning how to code at age 12. Currently proficient in C#, C++. Learning Rust.
- üéÆ Started learning how to use Unity at age 13. Made a couple of small games on [Itch](https://braveo.itch.io/). Learning Godot.
- üü¶ Released my first major game in 2021, titled RAYBOUND. It is free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1626370/Raybound/). 
- ü¶å Currently working on RAYBOUND: SUBNOVIAN LEGEND during my free time as I keep studying.
